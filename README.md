# stopwatch

## What I make it for
To develop a stopwatch for myself in order to obtain convenience when I'm playing Rubik's Cube.
And I'm trying to add some brilliant visual effect on this staff.

## What it needs
Since it's developed in PHP+JS, jQuery is the most simple library it needs.I have linked it in the codes.
It also needs a PHP library called pChart, which is used to display charts of the records. The version of pChart I used is Version 2.1.4. Be CAREFUL when using it because pChart Version 1.x is quite different from pChart Version 2.x.

## Usage
Just press SPACE to start or stop the stopwatch.
When it is displayed on mobile, touching the screen is also allowed instead of pressing SPACE.

## Feature
This stopwatch has different appearance in PC version and mobile version.But mobile version has fewer functions than PC version does while the core functions are the same.
